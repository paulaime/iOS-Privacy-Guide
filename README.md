<h1 align="center">iOS Privacy Guide</h1>

iOS is not the best OS for privacy. Only an open source and privacy-focused OS can provide the best privacy option and should be trusted. That said, many people love iOS and I'd like to share with you some privacy tools, apps and settings that can help iOS users.

## I – Settings

**1. Face ID and Touch ID** — The odds of an individual spoofing FaceID or Touch ID are quite low. They are a pretty secure and convenient way to lock/unlock your device but may be vulnerable to targeted attacks, so the choice of whether or not to activate it essentially depends on your threat model.

**2. Passcode** — Use a six digits or alphanumeric passcode to lock/unlock your device. A four digits passcode can be cracked pretty easily and won't protect your device for long. Set the option to require passcode immediately. Enable the “erase data” option (only if you know what you're doing).

**3. Lockscreen** – Make sure notifications as well as Siri are not publicly accessible on your lockscreen. Also set your screen to auto-lock, and do not set it to leave the screen turned on.

**4. Apple ID** – Enable two-factor authentification.

**5. iCloud** – Disable everything related to iCloud.

**6. Wi-Fi** – Block your phone from auto-joining hotspots and wireless networks.

**7. Bluetooth** – Always disable it unless needed.

**8. SIM** – Set a custom PIN for your SIM card (not 0000).

**9. Updates** – Enable automatic updates (to get security updates as soon as they're released).

**10. AirPlay & AirDrop** – Disable AirPlay, Handoff and AirDrop.

**11. Siri** – Disable everything from Siri and Search.

## II – Apps

**1. Web browser** – DuckDuckGo can be a good second web
