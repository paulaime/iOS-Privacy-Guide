<h1 align="center">iOS Privacy Guide</h1>

iOS is not the best OS for privacy. Only open source and privacy-focused OS can provide the best privacy option and should be trusted. That said, many people love iOS and I'd like to share with you some privacy tools, apps and settings that can help iOS users.

## I – Settings

**1. Face ID and Touch ID** — The odds of an individual spoofing FaceID or Touch ID are quite low. They are a pretty secure and convenient way to lock/unlock your device but may be vulnerable to targeted attacks, so the choice of whether or not to activate it essentially depends on your threat model.

**2. Passcode** — You should use a six digits or alphanumeric passcode to lock/unlock your device. A four digits passcode can be cracked pretty easily and won't protect your device for long.
